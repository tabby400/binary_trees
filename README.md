#### BINARY TREES
A binary tree can be used to organize data such as numbers in a hierarchical annd structured way. Every node on the tree can at most have up to two children thus referred to as a binary tree. The root node is at the very top of the tree and holds the piece of information you would like to organize, then there are nodes and each node can hold up to two children one on the left and the other on the right. The nodes at the vety bottom of the binaty tree with no children are known as leaves.

##### The Requirements
- The editors allowed are emacs, vi and vim
- Files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are allowed to use the standard library
- Prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called binary_trees.h

#### The tasks
- a function that creates a binary tree node
- function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node
- function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node
- a function that deletes an entire binary tree
- a function that checks if a node is a leaf
- a function that checks if a given node is a root
- a function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal
- function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal
- a function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal
- a function that measures the height of a binary tree
- a function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree
- function that measures the size of a binary tree
- a function that counts the leaves in a binary tree
- a function that counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree
- a function that measures the balance factor of a binary tree
- a function that checks if a binary tree is full
- a function that checks if a binary tree is perfect
